## Creating your Empire

When you join a galaxy, you will be able to choose a race that you want your empire's people to be.  Predefined races offer a variety of bonuses and penalties depending on the style you'd like to play.

You also have an option to create a custom race with your choice of abilites and attributes. If this is your first time playing Imperial Conflict, it is recommended that you choose a predefined race.

Remember, you aren't allowed to have more then 1 account, even if they are in different galaxies.

## Navigation

The game consists of 2 primary navigation areas. The first is the top navigation bar, where you can click or tap the icons to access different game pages.  This bar itself will show different icons depending on different circumstances.

### Top Navigation Bar

#### Regular Mode: Narrow

If you're playing on a mobile browser, or your desktop window is sized small enough, you will see the following 5 icons:

1) Task Bar: This toggles display of the left navigation menu.

2) Family Forums: This takes you to your family forum.

3) Home: This takes you to your Empire HQ page.

4) Map: This takes you to the galactic map.

5) Account: This toggles display of the right navigation menu.

#### Regular Mode: Wide

If your display is wide enough, the left/right navigation menus will be displayed on your screen along with the main game content.  In this state, the Task Bar and Account icons are no longer needed and will disappear.

#### Map Mode

When you are on the map page, the icons are replaced so as to make your map navigation easier.  The icons in this page are as follows:

1) Zoom In: This zooms the map in.

2) Zoom Out: This zooms the map out.

3) Home: This takes you to your Empire HQ page.

## Your Family and Home System

After you decide which galaxy you will want to join, you have your own planet in a system called your home system.  In this system are other empires and their home planets.  These empires are your family members, and this is your family.  This is your team.

You can view your family's page by clicking the "Family" link on the left sidebar and choosing "Overview".  This will show you all the other empires that are in your family, along with a subnavigation with other relevant links.

One of the first things you want to do is post in your family's forum to introduce yourself.  A lot of good planning happens here and it's a great place to offer help and/or ask questions.

## Growing your empire

You will quickly outgrow your home planet, and need more space to build on.  The easiest way to do this is to explore an unclaimed planet.

### Exploration

Provided that you are at least 50% built on your available planet space, you will be able to send exploration ships to unclaimed planets.

### Attacking

If there are no unclaimed planets avaialable, you can take planets from other players by buildng a fleet and attacking the planet you'd like to take.  In order to win the planet, you must win the final phase (ground fight).
