## Creating your Empire

When you join a galaxy, you will be able to choose the race of your empire's citizens.  Predefined races offer a variety of bonuses and penalties depending on the style you prefer to play. 

You also have an option to create a custom race with your choice of abilites and attributes. If this is your first time playing Imperial Conflict, it is recommended that you choose a predefined race.

Remember, you aren't allowed to have more then 1 account, even if they are in different galaxies.

## Navigation

The game consists of 2 primary navigation areas. The first is the top navigation bar, where you can click or tap the icons to access different game pages.  This bar itself will show different icons depending on different circumstances.

### Top Navigation Bar

#### Regular Mode: Narrow

If you're playing on a mobile browser, or your desktop window is sized small enough, you will see the following 5 icons:

1) Task Bar: This toggles display of the left navigation menu.

2) Family Forums: This takes you to your family forum.

3) Home: This takes you to your Empire HQ page.

4) Map: This takes you to the galactic map.

5) Account: This toggles display of the right navigation menu.

#### Regular Mode: Wide

If your display is wide enough, the left/right navigation menus will be displayed on your screen along with the main game content.  In this state, the Task Bar and Account icons are no longer needed and will disappear.

#### Map Mode

When you are on the map page, the icons are replaced so as to make your map navigation easier.  The icons in this page are as follows:

1) Zoom In: This zooms the map in.

2) Zoom Out: This zooms the map out.

3) Home: This takes you to your Empire HQ page.

4) Map: This takes you to the galactic map.

5) Show Systems: This toggles display of system highlighter, which will let you view different groups of solar systems depending on your selection.

### Side Navigation Menus

The side navigation bars offer access to the full functionality of the game.  This is where you will click or tap around to perform most of your game actions.

#### Left Navigation Menu

##### Overview

This page tells you the current amount of gold and resources your empire has saved. It tells you the population of your empire and  morale. It has an area for a message from your leader. This area will show any recent reports,  such as aid shippments, attacks, operations,  or newly explored planets.
This area will also show Galactic News, which describes the goings on of other players in the galaxy. 

##### Council

This page tells you your hourly production of cash and resources. It also tells you how many of each kind of different buildings and units under your control. Below that are the buildings currently under construction in the queue. You also have the option to demolish all of a building type. Additionally, you can cancel buildings and fleet that are under construction and be refunded 75% of the cost. 

##### Galaxy Map

It will take you to the outside world to the galaxy. Here you can explore for new planets and also attack. At the top of the map sidebar is a toggle switch that will take you back to the navigator sidebar.

##### Planets

This is a list of all your planets. You can sort them by coordinates, overbuilt, and resources. It also shows your laser count, whether or not there are stationed units, and if the planet is portaled or not.

##### Fleets

It will show you how many units of each type you have in your main fleet. Below that it will tell you if you have fleet en route to another planet or if they are hovering and ready for you to trigger the attack. This also includes exploration ships heading to new planets.

##### Galactic Market

In a galaxy that allows this feature you can buy resources that you need or sell them for gold. Sometimes there is a market strike where the market is shut down for a period of time. Bids to buy resources will remain on the market until they are filled by another player selling the desired amount of resources. Gold stored in bids on the market will not decay in the same way bureaucracy decays 0.5% of saved gold. Because of this, it is possible to save large amounts of gold on the market in bids that will not be filled and cancel the order later so that losses from the 10% cancellation fee. Resources stored in the market as open bids still decay at the same 0.5% as resources saved normally. 

##### Family

This page will show you who your family members are. At the top of the page are different links. Here you can vote for a leader or you can send aid or even see how much is in the Defense fund and see where your defense stations are. The Family link also has 2 other links on the side for quick access to the News and Aid. Family chat is also included in this area, if your leader set a chat.  Leaders show in pink, your own name appears blue.

##### Diplomacy

Here you will see if there are any NAPs (Non-Aggression Pacts) and how long they will last, if war has been declared and who your allies are.

##### Messages

You can send and will receive messages here. You also have an outbox to see sent messages. Planet coordinates sent here are also clickable.

##### Quick Attack

To send an attack from this page you will need the coordinates of the target planet. After you click Evaluate Attack there will be boxes you can fill in for how much fleet you want to send. At the top it will tell you how much it will cost and how long it will take to get there.

##### Covert Operations

This is the place where you can do your agent ops. It tells you the amount of gold it will cost, and the amount of agents and operations that are left. When you pick which operation want to use, it then shows you the morale cost to do said op.

##### Magic

This page is where you do your spells. It tells you how much it will cost in octarine, how many wizards you have and how many spells are left. When you pick which spell you want to use, it then shows you the morale cost to do said spell.

##### Research

In this room is your research into 5 difference sciences. You have military, welfare, economy, construction and resources. You can change these settings to what you want but it must equal 100%. These settings will direct future research into the desired areas. Existing research centers contribute research points every hour and you also have the option to fund research with gold. Gold in the research fund will be consumed at 10% every hour. The consumed gold is converted to research points. 

##### Personal Log

You can make notes or keep information here for your own personal reference.

##### Rankings

This link will take you to the ranking page to show you where your family and your empires are compared to the other families in the galaxy. There are 3 different ranking systems: Score, Size & Networth.

##### Family Forum

This link will take you directly to your family forum. No other family can see it unless you have allies.



## Your Family and Home System

After you decide which galaxy you will want to join, you have your own planet in a system called your home system.  In this system are other empires and their home planets.  These empires are your family members, and this is your family.  This is your team.

You can view your family's page by clicking the "Family" link on the left sidebar and choosing "Overview".  This will show you all the other empires that are in your family, along with a subnavigation with other relevant links.

One of the first things you want to do is post in your family's forum to introduce yourself.  A lot of good planning happens here and it's a great place to offer help and/or ask questions.

## Growing your empire

You will quickly outgrow your home planet, and need more space to build on.  The easiest way to do this is to explore an unclaimed planet.

### Exploration

Provided that you are at least 50% built on your available planet space, you will be able to send exploration ships to unclaimed planets.

### Attacking

If there are no unclaimed planets avaialable, or if exploration cost to much for you,you can take planets from other players by buildng a fleet and attacking the planet you'd like to take.  In order to win the planet, you must win the final phase (ground fight). An attack is divided into three phases. In the first phase, attacking bombers attempt to destroy the existing lasers on the planet. Each bomber has a 10% chance to destroy a laser. If there are lasers that are not destroyed by attacking bombers, they will first shoot down attacking transports and then attacking bombers. Each laser will destroy 10 units. 

In the second phase, attacking and defending fighters combat each other. The maximum amount of attacking or defending fighters that can be destroyed is 30%. If the numbers on each side are equal, losses will be about 5% on each side. If there are plenty of defending fighters left after combat, then they have the chance to shoot down attacking transports. Up to 100% of transports can be destroyed by defending fighters.

The third and final phase is the ground fight. Any remaining transports will land and deploy attacking ground units. Droids are better at attacking than soldiers and soldiers are better at defending than droids. After ground units are destroyed, the empire with more ground units remaining will win the battle. If the attacker is successful, they will take control of the planet. If the defender has a networth of 70% or more of the attacker, the buildings on the planet will remain intact for the attacker. If the networth ratio is 35%-70%, the buildings will all be destroyed in the transfer of control. If the networth ratio is under 35%, the attacker will not take control of the planet. The planet will become uninhabited and and exploration ship will need to be sent to take control of the planet.
